## Synopsis

This project consists of a single Sage Notebook with functions for computing the [Waldspurger Transform of permutations and alternating sign matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03937).
It also has code for computing David Anderson's [essential set of signed permutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08670).  
Among other things, this allows one to compute the [base for type B](http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v3i2r27).

## Code Example

waldspurgerTransform(Permutation([1,4,3,2])

returns the matrix:

[[0,0,0],
[0,1,1],
[0,1,1]]

## Installation

To run this code, you'll need to have [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html) installed.  Alternatively, you can run it in the [cocalc](https://cocalc.com/) cloud.
